0,direct,What were Xiuquan's views on property and gender roles compared to traditional Chinese practices?,"In examining Xiuquan's views on property, one can see a clear rejection of traditional norms found in Chinese society. Xiuquan's insistence on the abolition of private property attracted many followers who were disillusioned with the existing feudal and economic hierarchies. Traditional Chinese practices were deeply entrenched in principles of familial loyalty and property ownership, where land and wealth were passed down through generations. By challenging these notions, Xiuquan sought to dismantle the existing social structures and foster a sense of community ownership among the peasantry, thus promising a more egalitarian community.  On the subject of gender roles, Xiuquan's advocacy for the separation of sexes marked a significant departure from traditional practices. He asserted that men and women should exist in distinct civil and military spheres, promoting a highly organized and regulated view of social interaction based on gender. This perspective contrasted with historical Chinese customs that allowed for more fluid interactions between genders in various social contexts. Furthermore, Xiuquan’s prohibitions against prostitution and drug use highlight his efforts to redefine morality and societal standards in a way that was distinctively different from the existing norms. His agenda aimed at reshaping gender relations was part of a broader vision to create a society rooted in his radical interpretations of faith and governance.  Thus, Xiuquan's views fundamentally challenged and aimed to redefine established norms regarding property and gender, demonstrating a comprehensive yet divisive vision for society.","Xiuquan advocated for communal ownership of property and promoted more egalitarian gender roles, challenging traditional Chinese practices of private property and patriarchal hierarchy.","Xiuquan advocated for communal ownership of property and promoted more egalitarian gender roles, challenging traditional Chinese practices of private property and patriarchal hierarchy.",0.13740458015267176,0.0008030366091509758,0.872793972492218
