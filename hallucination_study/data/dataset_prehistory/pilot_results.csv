The settled farmers on the coastal plains focused on agricultural practices, utilizing the advantages of fertile land to grow crops. Alternatively, the seminomadic pastoralists of the Atlas Mountains adapted their way of life to a more mobile existence, managing livestock and shifting with the seasons. In the Sahara, nomadic tribes thrived in the arid conditions, navigating the desert and engaging in trade.
